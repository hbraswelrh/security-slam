Now in its fifth iteration, the Slam helps projects understand and improve their high-level security posture.</p><p>\"Security hygiene is something every project should do—and every project can do it with a bit of guidance. It's everyday stuff, like the equivalent of brushing your teeth. After you learn it once, you can easily do it every day.\" — Christopher \"CRob\" Robinson, OpenSSF CTO & Chief Architect</p><h2>Key dates</h2><ul><li><strong>Friday, February 20, 2026</strong> — Event objectives announced; Slam Library opens</li><li><strong>Friday, March 20, 2026</strong> — Final scoring submissions close; scoring begins</li><li><strong>Thursday, March 26, 2026</strong> — Awards on the KubeCon Project Pavilion Stage</li></ul><h2>2026 format</h2><p>The 2026 event runs approximately one month (February 20 – March 20), leading up to KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe. Key elements:</p><ul><li><strong>Slam Library</strong> — A library of support resources (hosted on this site) to accelerate execution of the more complex goals</li><li><strong>Advisors</strong> — Available via a dedicated CNCF Slack channel all month for clarifications and questions on security hygiene</li><li><strong>Plaques & badges</strong> — Participating projects receive custom plaques; individual contributors receive badges corresponding to the project's completed goals</li><li><strong>Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)</strong> — Advisors and material will be available on CRA this year</li></ul><h2>Who can participate</h2><p>Previously restricted to CNCF projects, the Slam now uses the LFX Insights dashboard: if your project is published to LFX Insights by the closing date, you qualify. Projects from outside the CNCF and Linux Foundation are invited to participate.</p><h2>Partners</h2><p>The 2026 Security Slam is in partnership with Sonatype, OpenSSF, and OSTIF.</p><h2>History</h2><p>Past events have included incentives such as Google's 2022 donations for milestone-reaching projects or the 2025 LEGO prizes for top contributors. The 2023 event gave projects iron-on badges and framed plaques; that format had the most statistically significant results and inspired this year's structure. Maintainers have reported real wins—for example, work done during a prior Slam (pinning workflow versions) paid off when a GitHub action was later compromised.</p><p>Explore the <a href=\"/library\">Slam Library</a> for support resources.
