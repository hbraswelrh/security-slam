This is a placeholder library article. Add markdown files under `src/content/library/` with YAML frontmatter:

- **title** (required): Article title
- **description** (optional): Short summary
- **tags** (required): Topics this article belongs to (used to group articles on the library index)

The body below the frontmatter is rendered as markdown on the article page. You can use **bold**, *italic*, lists, code, and more.

## Next steps

1. Add more `.md` files to `src/content/library/`
2. Use consistent tags so topics group naturally
3. Link to library articles from the blog or other pages
