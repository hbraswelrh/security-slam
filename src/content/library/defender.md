## Challenge

Demonstrate robust completeness with the OSPS Baseline for your project's maturity level

## Why?

This is what we're all working toward in this Slam.

The culmination. The complete package.  The _magnum opus_.

The Inspector, Chronicler, Cleaner, and Mechanizer badges are stepping stones. Each one builds capability and demonstrates progress.

The Baseline is a minimum standard of what actually works in production open source projects, and any of our projects should be able to accomplish it with some dedicated effort.

The Defender badge lets you go up on a roof and shout about it when you finish.

## How?

The Defender badge is earned by completing the OSPS Baseline Best Practices Badge questionnaire for your project's maturity level, then posting the badge at the top of your README.

### The Best Practices Badge

Head to [bestpractices.dev](https://bestpractices.dev) and complete the OSPS Baseline questionnaire for your repository. You'll need admin access to your repo to get started.

The system autodetects a portion of the requirements, saving you time on things it can verify automatically. The rest is a straightforward questionnaire about your security practices and documentation.

Many projects already have OpenSSF Best Practices Badges (the "metal series" — passing, silver, gold). The OSPS Baseline badge works alongside those, focusing specifically on the controls defined in the Baseline catalog.

Once you've completed the questionnaire and met the requirements for your maturity level, you'll get a badge for your repository that shows your Baseline completeness.

### Getting There

This is a marathon, not a sprint. You have 30-days to complete this for a badge. You can start working in the Best Practices Badge portal and save your progress to return later.

The Defender badge will be waiting when you're ready.
