## Challenge

Achieve 100% on LFX Insights Security & Best Practices Dashboard or zero-failures with OSPS Baseline GitHub Action

## Why?

Come on, you understand this one.

You want things automated so that you can get answers at a glance. Your regulated users want things automated so they can get up-to-date information for their own conformity assessments. We want you to automate it so that we don't have to spend hours reviewing your Slam progress by hand. Everyone wins.

## How?

This one has two options, just like the [Inspector Badge]().

- Option 1: Onboard your Project to LFX Insights if it isn't already
- Option 2: Add the OSPS Baseline GitHub Action to your repo(s)

### Option #1

I know, options are annoying. So we've got a preferred order: Try to get your project onboarded to LFX Insights first.

If you're in the Linux Foundation, you're probably already covered here. If not, you'll need to [submit a request].

If your project is accepted, they'll do routine scans and keep historical records. The features on the platform are always expanding, and they include all sorts of elements beyond the Security & Best Practices tab. It's a huge win.

Also, this has a _subset_ of the control evaluations from Option 2. It's the same scanner under the hood, but the LFX maintainers hand-pick which evaluations they calculate into the final score. So it takes longer to get approved, but it's faster to get everything passing.

### Option #2
