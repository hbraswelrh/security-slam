The *CNCF Technical Advisory Group for Security & Compliance* is excited to announce the upcoming 2026 Security Slam at KubeCon \+ CloudNativeCon Europe, in partnership with Sonatype, OpenSSF, and OSTIF.

The event will run from ***Friday, February 20th*** until ***Friday, March 20th***.

The *Security Slam* is a CNCF community activity that has taken many different shapes over the years. Now on its fifth iteration, the Slam is designed to help projects understand and improve their high level security posture.

> _"Security hygiene is something every project should do — and every project can do it with a bit of guidance. It's everyday stuff, like the equivalent of brushing your teeth. After you learn it once, you can easily do it every day.”_
>
> _Christopher "CRob" Robinson, OpenSSF CTO & Chief Architect_

Previously restricted to CNCF projects due to the nature of the evaluation tools available, the Slam is now taking advantage of the new [LFX Insights](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/) dashboard to greatly broaden the qualifications for participation: If your project is published to LFX Insights by the closing date, you qualify to receive Slam recognitions.

Past events have included various incentives to encourage projects to make recommended improvements, such as Google’s 2022 [donations on behalf of projects who reach select milestones](https://www.cncf.io/reports/security-slam-north-america-2022/) or the 2025 [LEGO p rizes awarded to the top contributors](https://www.cncf.io/reports/security-slam-2025/) for each of the participating projects.

Similarly wide in variation, the event has had several permutations in its length. In the case of the [Kubernetes Lightning Round](https://www.cncf.io/reports/lightning-round-at-security-slam-2023/), the slam was a day of onboarding new contributors to Kubernetes with a focus on security hygiene improvements to seven different subprojects. Taking it a step further, the 2025 event featured weeks of preparatory work with maintainers, and 45-minute live sessions with maintainers and anyone who wanted to join from the audience at KubeCon \+ CloudNativeCon Europe.

This year, however, will imitate the event that had the most statistically significant results. In 2023, projects were given their own [iron-on badges and a framed plaque](https://www.cncf.io/reports/security-slam-2023/) to highlight the milestones that they completed during the 30-day event. Not only were the plaques seen at project tables *long* after the event ended, but we received reports of significant project wins due to the efforts achieved during that event.

> _"Work we completed on Argo during the Security Slam paid off big time when the tj-actions GitHub action got compromised. All our workflow versions were pinned during the previous Slam — but if they hadn't been, we'd have spent a massive amount of time rotating secrets."_

* Advisors will be available via a dedicated CNCF slack channel all month, to offer clarifications and answer questions related to security hygiene  
* Participating projects will be given custom plaques to demonstrate their successes  
* Individual contributors will be given badges corresponding to the project’s completed goals

And there are new elements as well:

* The Slam Library will be hosted on this site throughout the event
