Whether you're a maintainer, active contributor, interested in making contributions, or simply an end user cheering on the projects you depend on, getting up to speed with the Security Slam is a quick process.

## Let's get to know the flow

First, understand that this is not a traditional hackathon, though it shares some familiar elements.

There are no teams, only shared objectives. There are no presentations or scoring, only submission and evaluation. There are no prizes, only recognitions.

- Individuals who register may contribute in any way they see fit.
- Maintainers who register within the first week of the event may request to have their project added on the [Participating Projects](/slam26/participating-projects) page.
- Maintainers will submit completion notifications on the relevant badge page.
- All participants who are included on a final completion notification will qualify for a digital badge and physical pin issued by our sponsors.
- Projects who complete all objectives will qualify for a recognition on this website and a physical plaque issued by our sponsors.

This leads us to the next obvious question...

## What are the objectives?

The Slam has five key objectives that may be pursued by each project. These center around the _Open Source Project Security Baseline_ which was created by and for maintainers as a project within the [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org).

**We recommend starting with "The Cleaner"** - create your `SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml` file first with basic project information. You can complete this badge even without all the various documentation elements, then continuously add to it as you complete other badges. Each subsequent objective builds on this foundation.

- **Start Here - Objective #1: "The Cleaner"** helps projects articulate their progress in a machine-readable manner. Your Security Insights YAML file serves Slam evaluators and your regulated end-users alike, increasing confidence in your project's security posture. As you complete other objectives, add their documentation links to this file.
- Objective #2: "The Chronicler" recognizes completion of all OSPS Baseline documentation controls. At first glance, these may seem like red herrings in your security journey... but industry experts agree that good security practice is always preceded by good documentation. **Add documentation links to your Security Insights YAML as you create them.**
- Objective #3: "The Inspector" guides projects through security self-assessments. Two different approaches can earn this badge, both delivering valuable institutional knowledge. **Reference your self-assessment in your Security Insights YAML when complete.**
- Objective #4: "The Mechanizer" sets up automated evaluation for a subset of controls. Not all Baseline objectives can be automatically verified, but anything demonstrated this way helps streamline maintenance and boost adopter confidence.
- Objective #5: "The Defender" recognizes robust completeness with the OSPS Baseline for your project's maturity level. All other objectives are stair-steps working toward this comprehensive achievement.

Now based on who you are, your first steps may be different...

## So where should you begin?

For projects to be eligible for recognitions, a maintainer must sign up. A Slam Organizer will reach out shortly thereafter to confirm your registration.

To be eligible for individual recognitions, you need to personally register and there must be a confirmed registration by the project you're contributing to (Obviously this is two-in-one if you're contributing to a project you maintain).

You should pause and [Register Now](/slam26/register) if you haven't already.

Once that's sorted, it's recommended that you coordinate with other contributors through official project channels, such as GitHub Issues and Slack.

Contributions are typically less likely to be accepted if maintainers are surprised by them... and it'd be a tragedy to duplicate effort if someone else is already working on the same thing. Duplication often results in both efforts getting stalled indefinitely.

But as you're working...

## What if you have questions?

Slam Advisors are standing by to collaborate, speculate, give opinions, and share their experience. These are community members who have already been through the tasks you're completing now.

Common questions include:

- "Will any of my users care about this particular task?"
- "Will this thing over here have any real security outcomes?"
- "How thorough do I need to complete this part over here?"
- "Is my current progress on this objective good enough?"
- "How can I even accomplish this other thing?"

You can reach out to the pool of Slam Advisors, as well as peers who are currently engaged in the Slam, by joining the TAG Security and Compliance channel on the CNCF Slack server.
