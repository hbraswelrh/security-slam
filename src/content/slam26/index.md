Whether you're a maintainer, active contributor, interested in making contributions, or simply an end user cheering on the projects you depend on, getting up to speed with the Security Slam is a quick process.

## Let's get to know the flow

First, understand that this is not a traditional hackathon, though it shares some familiar elements.

There are no teams, only shared objectives. There are no presentations, only completion notifications. There are no prizes, only recognitions.

- Individuals who register may contribute in any way they see fit.
- Maintainers who register within the first week of the event may request to have their project added on the [Contributions Welcome] page.
- Maintainers will submit completion notifications on this site.
- All participants who are included on a final completion notification will qualify for a digital badge and physical pin issued by our sponsors.
- Projects who complete all objectives will qualify for a recognition on this site and a physical plaque issued by our sponsors.

This leads us to the next obvious question...

## What are the objectives?

The Slam has five key objectives that may be pursued by each project. These center around the _Open Source Project Security Baseline_ which was created by and for maintainers as a project within the [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org).

Objectives may be completed out of order, but each is designed to help accelerate completion of the next.

- Objective #1: "The Inspector" guides projects in the completion of a single complex documentation task: security self-assessments. There are two different ways this can be marked as complete, but it'll return dividends any way you go about it.
- Objective #2: "The Chronicler" recognizes the completion of all OSPS Baseline controls related to project documentation. At first glance, these may seem like red herrings in your project's security journey... but industry experts agree that good security practice is always preceded by good documentation.
- Objective #3: "The Cleaner" is designed to help projects articulate their progress toward baseline completion in a machine-readable manner. This helps Slam evaluators in the same way that it helps your regulated end-users: to increase confidence when forming an opinion on your project's security.
- Objective #4: "The Mechanizer" is the final step before full completion, setting up automated evaluation of a subset of controls. Not all Baseline control objectives can be automatically evaluated, but anything that can be demonstrated in this fashion helps streamline maintenance and boost confidence with adopters.
- Objective #5: "The Defender" is a badge issued to projects who demonstrate a robust completeness with the OSPS Baseline, especially as it pertains to your project's maturity level. All other objectives are stair-steps working toward this comprehensive achievement.

Now based on who you are, your first steps may be different...

## So where should _you_ begin?

For projects to be eligible for recognitions, a maintainer must sign up. A Slam Organizer will reach out shortly thereafter to confirm your registration.

To be eligible forindividual recognitions, you need to personally register and there must be a confirmed registration by the project you're contributing to (Obviously this is two-in-one if you're contributing to a project you maintain).

You should pause and [Register Now](/slam26/register) if you haven't already.

Once that's sorted, it's recommended that you coordinate with other contributors through official project channels, such as GitHub Issues and Slack.

Contributions are typically less likely to be accepted if maintainers are surprised by them... and it'd be a tragedy to duplicate effort if someone else is already working on the same thing. Duplication often results in both efforts getting stalled indefinitely.

But as you're working...

## What if you have questions?

Slam Advisors are standing by to collaborate, speculate, give opinions, and share their experience. These are community members who have already been through the tasks you're completing now.

Common questions include:

- "Will any of my users care about this particular task?"
- "Will this thing over here have any real security outcomes?"
- "How thorough do I need to complete this part over here?"
- "Is my current progress on this objective good enough?"
- "How can I even accomplish this other thing?"

You can reach out to the pool of Slam Advisors, as well as peers who are currently engaged in the Slam, by joining the TAG Security and Compliance channel on the CNCF Slack server.

- Join the CNCF Slack: [slack.cncf.io](https://slack.cncf.io)
